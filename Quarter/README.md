# FAM_M2 (Quarter size)
User guide of how to use the code

## SQNR check
Run python3 SQNR_check.py
The result of computation and simulation is saved in ./Result/MR

## Implementation
Run python3 FullFlow_syn.py
The Interface_report is saved in ./Result/Interface_report/Quarter

## Check with Jupyter on ZCU111 
Run SCD_full_3out.ipynb on ZCU111 will get the execution time and SQNR result.
Run SCD_full_3out_Dummy.ipynb on ZCU111 will get the interface delay of Quarter size SCD.
